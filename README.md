# 2016-ml-contest
Machine learning contest

Welcome to the *Geophysical Tutorial* Machine Learning Contest 2016! Read all about the contest in [the October 2016 issue](http://library.seg.org/toc/leedff/35/10) of the magazine. Look for Brendon Hall's tutorial on lithology prediction with machine learning.

**You can run the notebooks in this repo in the cloud, just click the badge below:**

You can also clone or download this repo with the green button, above, or just read the documents:

- [index.ipynb](index.ipynb) &mdash; All about the contest.
- [Facies_classification.ipynb](Facies_classification.ipynb) &mdash; Brendon's notebook with all the code you need to get started in machine learning in Python.


## Getting started with Python

Please refer to the [User guide to the geophysical tutorials](http://library.seg.org/doi/abs/10.1190/tle35020190.1) for tips on getting started in Python and find out more about Jupyter notebooks.


## Find out more about the contest

To find out more please read the article in [the October issue](http://library.seg.org/toc/leedff/35/10) or read the manuscript in the [`tutorials-2016`](https://github.com/seg/tutorials-2016) repo.


## Rules

We've never done anything like this before, so there's a good chance these rules will become clearer as we go. We aim to be fair at all times, and reserve the right to make judgment calls for dealing with unforeseen circumstances.

- You must submit your result as code and we must be able to run your code.
- **We are still working out the exact details of the comparison criteria. For now, please hold the SHANKLE well as a blind test.** See [issue #2 regarding this point.](https://github.com/seg/2016-ml-contest/issues/2).
- The result we get with your code is the one that counts as your result.
- To make it more likely that we can run it, your code must be written in Python or R or Julia **or Lua** [updated 26 Oct].
- The contest is over at 23:59:59 UT (i.e. midnight in London, UK) on 31 January 2017. Pull requests made aftetr that time won't be eligible for the contest.
- If you can do even better with code you don't wish to share fully, that's really cool, nice work! But you can't enter it for the contest. We invite you to share your result through your blog or other channels... maybe a paper in *The Leading Edge*.
- This document and documents it links to will be the channel for communication of the leading solution and everything else about the contest.
- This document contains the rules. Our decision is final. No purchase necessary. Please exploit artificial intelligence responsibly.
