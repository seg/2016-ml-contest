    "\n",
    "**Welcome to an experiment!**\n",
    "\n",
    "You mission, should you choose to accept it, is to make the best lithology prediction you can. We want you to try to beat the accuracy score Brendon Hall achieved in his Geophyscial Tutorial (TLE, October 2016). \n",
    "\n",
    "First, read the [open access](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_access) tutorial by Brendon in [the October issue of *The Leading Edge*](http://library.seg.org/toc/leedff/35/10). \n",
    "\n",
    "Here's the text of that box again:\n",
    "\n",
    "> I hope you enjoyed this month's tutorial. It picks up on a recent wave of interest in artificial intelligence approaches to prediction. I love that Brendon shows how approachable the techniques are — the core part of the process only amounts to a few dozen lines of fairly readable Python code. All the tools are free and open source, it's just a matter of playing with them and learning a bit about data science.\n",
    "\n",
    "> In the blind test, Brendon's model achieves an accuracy of 43% with exact facies. We think the readers of this column can beat this — and we invite you to have a go. The repository at [github.com/seg/2016-ml-contest](http://github.com/seg/2016-ml-contest) contains everything you need to get started, including the data and Brendon's code. We invite you to find a friend or two or more, and have a go!\n",
    "\n",
    "> To participate, fork that repo, and add a directory for your own solution, naming it after your team. You can make pull requests with your contributions, which must be written in Python, R, or Julia. We'll run them against the blind well — the same one Brendon used in the article — and update the leaderboard. You can submit solutions as often as you like. We'll close the contest at **23:59 UT on 31 January 2017**. There will be a goody bag of completely awesome and highly desirable prizes for whoever is at the top of the leaderboard when the dust settles. The full rules are in the repo.\n",
    "\n",

    "- Find a friend or two or ten (optional) and form a team.\n",
    "- To get a copy of the repo that you can make pull requests from (that is, notify us that you want to send us an entry to the contest), you need to [fork the repo](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo/)\n",
    "- Use Jupyter Notebook (to make our life easy!) with Python, R, or Julia kernels, or write scripts and put them in the repo in a directory named after your team. \n",
    "- When you have a good result, send it to us by [making a pull request](https://help.github.com/articles/about-pull-requests/).\n",
    "- Everyone can see your entry. If you're not familiar with open source software, this might feel like a bug. It's not, it's a feature. If it's good, your contribution will improve others' results. Welcome to reproducible science!\n",

    "\n",
    "To make it even easier to try machine learning for yourself, you can launch this notebook on [**mybinder.org**](http://www.mybinder.org/) and run it there. You can load the data, change the code, and do everything... except enter the contest. Everything on your mybinder.org machine is **temporary**. If you make something awesome, be sure to use **File > Download as... > Notebook (.ipynb)** to save it locally. Then you can fork the repo in GitHub, add your new notebook, and make your pull request."

    "- If you can do even better with code you don't wish to share fully, that's really cool, nice work! But you can't enter it for the contest. We invite you to share your result through your blog or other channels... maybe a paper in *The Leading Edge*.\n",
